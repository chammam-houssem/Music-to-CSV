- `templates/library.html` - Library display page
- `music_library.db` - SQLite database (created automatically)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Technical Details

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Storage:** SQLite database with songs and lyrics tables
- **YouTube API:** Uses YouTube Data API v3 (with oEmbed fallback)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with gradient backgrounds and modern design

## YouTube API Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For better metadata extraction, you can set up a YouTube Data API v3 key:

1. **Get a YouTube API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the YouTube Data API v3
   - Create credentials (API key)

2. **Set the API Key:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   set YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # macOS/Linux
   export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Benefits with API Key:**
   - More accurate artist/channel information
   - Better quality thumbnails (maxres, high quality)
   - Published date for more accurate year extraction
   - Higher rate limits
   - More reliable metadata extraction

**Note:** The app works without an API key using the oEmbed API as fallback, but you'll get better results with the official API.

## Notes

- The app uses YouTube Data API v3 with oEmbed API as fallback
- With an API key: Better metadata, higher quality thumbnails, published dates
- Without API key: Still works using oEmbed API (no authentication required)
- Producer information is not available through the YouTube API
- Year and album information is extracted from video titles and published dates
- All data is stored locally in `music_data.csv`
- The app is designed to be lightweight and easy to use

## Troubleshooting

- **"Could not extract metadata"** - Make sure the URL is a valid YouTube video
- **"Network error"** - Check your internet connection
- **Port already in use** - Change the port in `app.py` or stop other services using port 5000
